Europe: I'll be back
Title: Europe: I'll Be Back!

Introduction:
The European economy has shown remarkable resilience in recent times, defying the odds and emerging stronger than ever. With a shift in sector makeup, attractive valuations, and a robust growth trajectory, Europe is poised to make a strong comeback in 2023.

Defying the Odds:
Despite challenges such as the energy crisis and global economic headwinds, Europe has managed to maintain steady growth. The milder winter helped avoid the worst-case scenario of the energy crisis, and near stagnation growth is expected at the start of 2023. European equities have experienced a sharp rally since the beginning of the year, with investor flows turning positive and valuations remaining attractive.

Sector Make-up Shift:
Europe has seen a shift in its sector makeup from lower growth industries to higher-quality companies such as luxury goods and semiconductors. This change has contributed to the overall growth and resilience of the European economy. Banks have reported stellar profits, lower gas prices have benefited industrials companies, and luxury brands like LVMH continue to go from strength to strength.

Attractive Valuations:
European stocks are currently trading at a 13x forward price-to-earnings ratio, below their 14.5x 10-year average. Europe's discount to the United States is expected to narrow to around 20% by the end of the year. This dramatic reset in valuations has created the most attractive entry point for stocks and bonds in over a decade.

China's Reopening and Export-Oriented Companies:
Europe is set to benefit from China's faster reopening, as export-oriented companies will likely see a boost in demand. Investors are advised to focus on beneficiaries of China's reopening and unleashed consumer demand, with a preference for quality stocks with international exposure in consumer discretionary and health care sectors.

Currency Outlook:
The currency outlook also plays a role in Europe's resurgence, with further USD weakness and EUR/USD expected to reach 1.15 by year-end. This weaker U.S. dollar adds an extra kicker for U.S. investors, who currently allocate only around 3% of their total equity allocation to Europe.

Central Banks and Recession Delay:
Central banks have signaled a shift in tone, with the European Central Bank (ECB) remaining hawkish and planning two 50 basis points rate hikes. Passive quantitative tightening is set to start in March, and European equities have rallied on the news of a delayed recession.

Conclusion:
Europe is making a strong comeback in 2023, with a resilient economy, attractive valuations, and a shift in sector makeup. Investors should keep an eye on the region as it continues to defy the odds and emerge stronger than ever.

Question Answering
Is it a good time to hold more cash?
Based on the information provided, holding too much cash in 2023 is not recommended due to inflation, falling rates, and better return opportunities in other assets.
